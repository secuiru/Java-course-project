Java course finalproject

Aim of the project was to create springboot application with data models, controller and basic REST interface to create new courses and add students to them.

Service class has functionality to add and get students/courses, add student to specific course, get courses where the student is enrolled to and
get all students that have enrolled to a course.

FileService class saves session data, so when the application is restarted students and courses are read from file.
